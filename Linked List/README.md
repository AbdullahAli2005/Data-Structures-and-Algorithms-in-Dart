# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Dart

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Dart. Each file represents a specific topic or concept in DSA, explained with detailed comments and sample usage in the `main()` function.

## Files Overview

### 01_CLL_creation.dart
This file contains the implementation of a Circular Linked List (CLL). Key features include:
- Node creation
- Adding nodes to the list
- Traversing the list

### 02_CLL_traversal.dart
Implementation focuses on:
- Traversing a Circular Linked List (CLL) and printing all the elements.

### 03_CLL_insertion.dart
Features of this implementation:
- Inserting nodes at the beginning, end, and specific indexes in a Circular Linked List.

### 04_CLL_deletion.dart
This file covers deletion operations in a Circular Linked List:
- Deleting the first node
- Deleting the last node
- Deleting a node at a specific index
- Deleting a node with a specific value

### 11_Doubly_Linked_List.dart
Implementation of Doubly Linked List (DLL):
- Appending nodes
- Traversing the list forward and backward

### 12_DLL_insertion.dart
Features of this implementation:
- Inserting nodes at the beginning, end, after a specific node, before a specific node, and at a specific index in a Doubly Linked List.

### 13_DLL_deletion.dart
This file includes deletion operations for a Doubly Linked List:
- Deleting the first node
- Deleting the last node
- Deleting a node at a specific index

### How to Use
