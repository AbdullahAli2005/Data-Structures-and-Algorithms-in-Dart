# Dart DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms in Dart  

Welcome to the **Dart DSA** repository! This collection showcases implementations of various data structures and algorithms written in Dart. It serves as a resource for learners, developers, and enthusiasts who want to explore DSA concepts and their practical applications in Dart programming.  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into the following categories, each containing relevant implementations:  

- **Arrays**: Operations and algorithms related to arrays.  
- **Graphs**: Algorithms like BFS, DFS, and graph traversal techniques.  
- **Linked List**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.  
- **Queues**: Queue data structures, including circular and priority queues.  
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and traversal algorithms.  
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, and other searching techniques.  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Merge sort, quicksort, bubble sort, and more.  

Each folder contains the relevant Dart files implementing the data structures and algorithms.  

## Note on File Naming  

The files in this repository are named with a numbering system, such as `25_Merge_Sort` and `31_Depth_First_Search`. This numbering reflects the sequence in which I studied and implemented these concepts. If you are a fresher, this numbering may provide a helpful learning orderâ€”but feel free to explore them in any sequence!  

Explore the folders to find the implementations you are interested in. Each folder contains a README.md file explaining the algorithms or data structures in detail.
